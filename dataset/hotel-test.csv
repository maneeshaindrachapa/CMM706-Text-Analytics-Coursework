0,My daughter and I just returned from a four night stay at the Pulitzer and were very disappointed.,0
1,I had searched for a good hotel at a rate of up to $300 a day and after much research decided on the Pulitzer.,0
2,Big mistake.,0
14,We saw a lot of tour groups in the hotel,0
23,"In summary, I would not spend the money to stay at the Sheraton Pulitzer, and would hope that this is not typical of Starwood luxury properties.",0
25,I mainly chose the property for it's location (I used to live in the neighborhood and absolutely love the area).,0
36,How odd is it to get the same room twice?,0
37,"Well I did, and since staying in it 3 years ago,",0
44,"In addition to their attitude, cobwebs and dust were prevalent",0
45,and the only thing that changed from day to day was a made bed.,0
51,3 Positive Aspects:1. The location.,0
53,and the canal location is exquisite.,0
56,Staying in a canal house is an experience and makes the hotel very unique and Dutch.,0
60,I guess I just don't have the proper appreciation for the difficulty in joining 20 odd canal houses together to make a hotel.,0
61,Or maybe it was just my expectations of what I would find in the way of a five star property.,0
62,"But in any event, I was underwhelmed with the Pulitzer.",0
66,"In fact, there are many apartments that are considerably smaller (okay, so I peeked in the windows of way too many apartments as I walked along the canals).",0
71,No central lobby to speak of.,0
73,I mean awful.,0
80,this hotel is truely the best in amsterdam and an enjoyable place to stay.,0
85,our 3 pound little dog just loved it and felt like home immediately.,0
88,i honestly cant find anything bad to say about the pulitzer and staff given the price/reward ratio.,0
89,In fact by looking @ price/reward i find the Pulitzer to be in the highest category of 5 star hotels ive been to...,0
91,Location just cant be beat....,0
94,This place is killer and happy to return shortly...,0
95,Just spent 3 nights at this hotel 5th March 04 -8th March 04. The location is excellent,0
99,my husband and I were on the third floor the people staying above on the 4th could have been in the room with us.,0
102,"I had communicated 6 months in advance, requesting Canal side room with access to elevator as my travelling partner was my 76 year old mother.",0
103,Confirmed in email by the hotel for this advance request.,0
104,"Yet, arrived on date planned.",0
116,"we got one that was smelling very heavily the cigar (so an other 20mn to change and get an other room)3) they were sorry for this,",0
119,"I said that i was not willing to pay,",0
121,"This was the first day, nice....unfortunatly we pre-paid the 3 nights (325 euros per night...not cheap for Amsterdam),",0
123,"I told in their survey what i was thinking about their hotel,",0
124,"the answer  we are very sorry, and hope to see you again at the Pulitzer.",0
126,"Everybody now that i meet, i tell them to NEVER go to this hotel.",0
127,Got a great rate for this hotel on hotwire ($195 per night) so was really pleased to be staying here.,0
134,I had some reservations about booking with the Pulitzer after reading the mixed reviews but was talked into it by my travel agent who books high end travel.,0
140,We were woken up by a mouse scratching at the door trying to get out of our room.,0
144,but I can see where it gets spotty reviews.,0
146,The hard part is that is a far better hotel than most amsterdam hotels so.....,0
150,and with that range of experiences here is what to expectGood:Location and concept (row houses around two canals)Beds,0
156,and I got food poisoning onceService attitude,0
163,and the Amstel is very good but very old fashioned,0
164,We had made reservations for this hotel,0
171,"I planned a trip with my parents who are 70yo,",0
172,and I wanted to treat them with a nice experience in one of the best hotel in Amsetrdam.,0
177,Orrible experience!,0
179,My parents were shocked!,0
182,"the concierge could not find me tickets for any concert in town,",0
183,the staff is tired and not helpfull.,0
191,"The Hotel's location is brilliant, and within walking distance of the rest of the city.",0
192,"The Moroccan door and bar staff likewise were helpful, polite and efficient.",0
194,"and management were lazy, rude, complacent and could not manage anything without conflict including the printing a bill when checking out.",0
195,"After refusing them a carte blanche on my credit card they remarkably had a working computer and printer, after claiming billing problems.",0
196,They then tried to pull the same trick on Asian members of my traveling party.,0
197,"When I left, the lobby resembled the port at Rotterdam all morning because someone could not organize somewhere else (e.g. an empty conference room?) to put the luggage of a German coach holiday.",0
198,"Given the attitude of the senior staff, I think they may be getting more English stag parties and elderly coach tourists than those the Starwood group desire.",0
199,I stayed at the Hotel Pulitzer in the beginning of January.,0
210,Stayed at the Pulitzer for business at the beginning of June 2005.,0
213,Breakfast for Euro 20 was OK!,0
214,The location is great!,0
219,It was my 5th visit in Amsterdam but my frist stay at the Pulitzer.,0
220,Thanks I got a special price endless week end wich make the price for the room at 215 Euros the night.,0
222,Thanks I did not have to pay this price !!,0
227,"Location is nice, bar is nice, staff friendly but I'd rather put my money in another hotel next time.",0
241,"We used the room service for dinner the first night because we arrived late,",0
244,"Having booked a deluxe room at the Pulitzer, we were very much looking forward to our one night stay.",0
246,"and more tatty the further we went,",0
247,our expectations were disappointed.,0
248,"Finally, having lugged our suitcases up a winding and dirty staircase we got to our room.",0
254,We were extremely unimpressed by the quality of service we encountered.,0
258,The high price we paid to stay here does not represent value for money as far as we are concerned,0
260,Stayed there on New Year's Eve in a reward room so it was free.,0
266,Rooms facing the canal may get much better view.,0
272,The hotel itself lies along a grand canal in a beautiful and historic Amsterdam neighborhood.,0
274,My husband and I went for a romantic weekend and are already getting ready to book again for the holiday season!,0
276,I have stayed here twice recently and have to say I am extremely disappointed in it.,0
279,I stayed during the week on a business trip.,0
283,"Also, simple requests are never followed through",0
284,and this includes my wake up call which didn't happen and asking for an iron which never arrived.,0
289,I really can't see how it gets away with claiming to be in any way a 'luxury hotel.,0
290,It's a row of houses converted into a hotel which is run in a poor to decidedly average manner.,0
296,"Stayed here for 3 nights in May 08, in an executive canal room.",0
297,"Good stuffThe location is the best in Amsterdam, away from the noise and sometimes seedy side of Amsterdam.",0
299,and the houses with big tall windows and was light,0
301,Staff were friendly and most were helpful Great restaurants,0
314,and we were shocked!,0
315,As the hotel was full then no upgrades were availableDue to the lack of soundproofing noise travels,0
316,and we had noisy neighbours next door,0
318,Our trip was a special occasion,0
319,and we had booked champagne,0
323,but for the difference in price I had assumed it would be!,0
328,and sunday morning - monday was much better for service as a whole,0
329,and I guess that during the week is much better and quietier.,0
332,We left it too late,0
333,and paid too much for what we got.,0
336,We were planning to stay at this hotel,0
339,"Every other hotel in the Netherlands agreed to refund our money, but not this one.",0
341,"In fact, they were very rude",0
345,"In fact, when we talked with Starwood about this policy, they actually told us that it was up to the local manager to make the determination.",0
347,I stayed at the hotel during my first trip to Amsterdam.,0
349,As a SPG I was updated to a wonderful room at the end of the hallway.,0
350,ALthough it wasn't a huge room by any means it was big enough for me.,0
362,the up and downs it takes to get to one's room gets old.,0
372,"The front desk girl, Alexis, was not too friendly and rather negative.",0
387,"So I moved to the Amstel Hotel, a true 5 star!",0
391,It was not until months later that the credit card company resolved the matter in our favor.,0
392,I am shocked at the way this matter was mishandled by the hotel.,0
393,I am shocked by the other reviews.,0
394,I travel for business on a daily basis,0
409,I was shocked needless to say that they basically accused the front desk of stealing...,0
410,I make the next biggest mistake of going to eat at the resturant.. and eating...,0
411,I got violently ill...,0
412,I spent the next day in bed...,0
413,I return to the Bar the next night after recovering..,0
414,and the bar tender asks me how my night was ...,0
415,I mention how ill I got,0
416,and he asked what I ate I mentioned it an he shook his head and bought me a shot...,0
419,I called down on the 4th day and said I have not been able to stay connected for more that 5 minutes...,0
422,and ---I was told would you like me to give you the number again....,0
430,I know I was rude with the last comment.,0
432,I wish I experienced the service that the previous guests experienced.,0
433,Stayed here recently for 3 nights.,0
436,I am a Starwood Platinum member,0
437,and checked in assuming I would be given my upgrade to the best available room (this wording according to policies by Starwood).,0
448,But i called the duty manager the next night and asked for a larger room.,0
449,At first he fed me some story about small rooms.,0
454,"They tried to just give me an upgrade to the next class of room, not the best class.",0
457,Other things to note: PROS: 2 free stroopfwaffles each day; GREAT BEDS!,0
473,but given what we paid we expected more.,0
485,"Overall, for what they charged I was expecting more.",0
486,"After much research, I finally decided on this hotel because of its position in Amsterdam and being classed asluxury seemed an ideal choice for my daughter and I to spend a weekend as her special birthday treat.",0
492,"At Reception the Night-Duty Manager(female) whose name I have noted, appeared to resent being interrupted whilst in conversation with a friend, her expression when I told her what we thought was the cause; practically a sneer of disbelief.",0
496,"At no point did she seem interested,I could feel my professional face about to develop.",0
497,"Because I did not wish to spoil my daughter's first visit, I did not pursue the matter as vociferously as I would normally, or when with my husband.",0
502,"In conclusion, a disappointing choice when one compares this hotel with others experienced, of a supposed lesser category.",0
505,My family and I had a nice and trouble free 4 night stay at the Pulitzer.,0
514,"Family-Friendly As a couple with a young child (toddler) in tow, we appreciated the ample and uncrowded public spaces more than the room itself.",0
527,"Between the points and a corporate rate, we were only supposed to pay about 800 Euros for a 5 night stay, which seemed very reasonable.",0
528,"When we arrived, we received the same treatment at the front desk as many previous reviewers...",0
531,and they were generally disorganized and not very cordial (though not rude).,0
538,The furniture was nice but shabby - scratched and dented.,0
539,"Being on the canal had its perks, but we could hear people walking by (talking, shouting and laughing) until the wee hours.",0
544,We heard banging during the day.,0
549,"and while the breakfast was great, I wouldn't spend the extra 75 Euros a night to include it in the price of my room (seemingly the only differentiator between a regular room and executive).",0
550,"We did spend 38 Euros pp to take a 1.5 hour ride on their lovely canal boat, which would have been great if not for a family with a baby who showed up late with a stroller and displaced other passengers.",0
556,"We booked a three-night stay using Starpoints, arriving December 30, 2008.",0
558,"I am a Starwood Platinum,",0
559,and I was informed that no upgrades were available because the hotel was sold out for new years eve.,0
562,"Later that evening, I checked the hotel's website and saw that the hotel was not sold out.",0
566,"We could hear noises in the hallway, from the room above us, and from the heater.",0
573,We stayed at the Pulitzer some time ago (August of 2007) so some memories are lost.,0
576,"We had a friend that stayed in a neighborhood closer to the red light district, and let me say...",0
577,we spent a lot more time in our neighborhood.,0
586,They have their own canal boat for tours,0
589,"but that is the norm for Amsterdam apparently (when our friend came over he said his room was ""pretty much the size of our bathroom...no, seriously!""",0
591,"We were on the first floor on the canal, but was a bit noisy from road noise and some construction work being done.",0
594,"Non-existent service, poor food, rude attitude, overwhelmed staff, noisy, stuffy rooms.",0
598,My problems began when i arrived early for check in- 10am.,0
600,As you can imagine i refused- not a good way to start your holiday.,0
603,Views looked out to another building almost immediatly opposite,0
604,and the lack of light was depressing (no ceiling light).,0
609,"To all their fairness they refunded back 1/3 of my fee, that still leaves 200 euros for the night which is still a ludicrous price for that hotel- My advise?",0
611,I just read some of the bad reviews for the Pulitzer,0
612,and I couoldn't agree more.,0
613,Last year the hotel was still getting raves,0
614,and it's about time that the reviews reflect how bad the place really is.,0
619,but at least we faced the courtyard instread of being in the attic.,0
621,The concierge consistantly gave bad advice if he gave any at all.,0
631,we were very excited to see that.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-18.json_0,I stayed at the Westin Grand this past weekend during my trip to Berlin to run the marathon.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-18.json_1,As a family member of a Starwood Hotels employee I have stayed at many Westin properties,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-18.json_2,and this one was about in the middle in terms of quality.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-18.json_3,"On the plus side, the location was great.",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-18.json_4,"It is close to public transportation, close to many of the city attractions and close to the start of the marathon.",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-18.json_5,It also was great to have access to the spa and pool before and after the race.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-18.json_6,I also agree with many posters that the breakfast was great.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-18.json_7,They also did not charge me for my 7 year old son,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-18.json_8,and he eats quite a bit.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-18.json_9,"On the negative side, was the fact they did not change towels on one day",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-18.json_10,and only stocked the bathroom supplies once for a 3 night stay.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-18.json_11,"Additionally, room service for a pot of coffee took 1 hour.",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-18.json_12,I stayed in an unrenovated room with a view out the window onto Fredrichstrasse.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-18.json_13,This was nice since I could see a portion of the race route and could watch roller bladers,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-18.json_14,and runners go by from my window.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-18.json_15,Overall the stay was just above neutral.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-19.json_0,I stayed at the Westin Berlin 3 or 4 times.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-19.json_1,This time I stayed for two nights,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-19.json_2,and they gave me a room upgrade to a renovated room.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-19.json_3,Renovated?,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-19.json_4,"Yes, they call it renovated.",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-19.json_5,The renovated rooms are located to the courtyard and have the same size like the normal rooms.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-19.json_6,"Bad smell, ugly furniture, bad design, old fahioned, dirty, noisy a/c and not really a heavenly bed I guess.",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-19.json_8,"Still, the location is the best",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-19.json_9,and the lobby is very pritty and impressive.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-19.json_10,"But the rest of the hotel, forget about it.",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-19.json_11,Also the food at Friedrichs is boring and very traditional.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-2.json_0,My wife and I stayed two nights at this hotel at the end of February.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-2.json_1,"The carnival was in full swinging in Berlin, but not in this hotel.",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-2.json_2,"Granted, as you enter the lobby you feel that you are entering into a great hotel.",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-2.json_3,"The lobby is beautiful and has a luxurious feel, with a loveably staircase,",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-2.json_4,but the luxury ends right there.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-2.json_5,"The schizophrenic state starts as you begin walking to your room, what an awful smell in the corridor.",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-2.json_6,I concur with previous reviews;,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-2.json_7,I felt I was walking through a sewer.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-2.json_8,Then you enter the room.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-2.json_9,"A twin bedded room, and I mean twin and small beds.",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-2.json_10,Really separate beds.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-2.json_11,"Request for change was denied, notwithstanding my Starwood card.",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-2.json_12,No heavenly pillows; no heavenly beds; and no heavenly comforters here.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-2.json_13,I felt I was staying at a **star hotel room.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-2.json_14,Then you enter the bathroom.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-2.json_15,It must have been decorated by the owner of a hospital.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-2.json_16,"It was all white, with no goodies.",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-2.json_17,"I accept, however, that we had a balcony and a great view unto the Unter den Linden, but that was it.",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-2.json_18,"In conclusion, this is no *****star hotel.",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-3.json_0,I stayed at the Grand Westin several times.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-3.json_2,Lobby and location is perfect.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-3.json_3,Service is so so.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-3.json_4,I'm a Starwood Platinum Member and they didn't upgrade me!,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-3.json_5,They said it was a congress like Berlinale or so.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-3.json_6,"The rooms are so old fashioned, stinky and noisy.",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-3.json_7,Bathrooms are even worse.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-3.json_9,"In reality, rooms look different!",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-3.json_10,(and much worse!!),0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-4.json_0,"The best thing about the Westin, as everybody has already stated, is the location.",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-4.json_1,"But, this is not the only hotel in the area - The Hilton is just a few blocks away as are a few others that are in the 5 star range.",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-4.json_2,The big problem for me was the fact that the rooms have an ever present sewer smell that hits you as soon as you walk in the room.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-4.json_3,"I was prepared for this as many of the reviewers have mentioned it, but still, it is unacceptable.",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-4.json_4,"I was staying here with my Starwood Points,",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-4.json_5,"so the room and breakfast were included in the award,",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-4.json_6,but my points are valuable,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-4.json_7,and I felt like I wasted them on this hotel.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-4.json_8,"A curious thing for me was, when I walked outside the hotel, every so often, from Friedrichstrasse to the Brandenburg Gate,",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-4.json_9,that same awful smell would drift by.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-5.json_0,We had a small trip to Berlin this spring and choosed this hotel because it is easy to reach and in the heart of berlin.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-5.json_1,"Breakfast is one of the best I ever had,",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-5.json_2,but you have to wait quite a long time to get seated in this small and crowded breakfast room.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-5.json_3,"As this is a quite large luxury hotel, the rooms are really small.",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-5.json_4,"The room we got was nothing special, small, clean, thats it.",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-5.json_5,"Overall the hotel is quite ok,",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-5.json_6,but I had better ones.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-6.json_0,Just returned from a Great 3 night stay at the Westin on a fantastic priceline deal.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-6.json_1,I would agree with earlier reviews that this hotel doesn't quite make the 5 star status it claims but is a very good 4 star property.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-6.json_2,The hotel is located in the former East Berlin and is well placed for most of the sights.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-6.json_3,Getting around is easy thanks to the U-Bahn station practically on the doorstep.,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-6.json_4,"The public areas are very grand especially the lobby with its huge atrium, sweeping staircase and piano player.",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-6.json_5,Couldn't notice any strange smells in the lifts as mentioned by a previous poster.,0

berlin-hotel-191437-review-6.json_7,The room did show some signs of wear (nothing major though),0

berlin-hotel-191437-review-7.json_15,Reception staff were plain rude,0

berlin-hotel-191437-review-7.json_17,even if I had asked for a NS one because I happen to be Spanish,0

berlin-hotel-191437-review-9.json_8,"and it had a very strong, musty odour (mould perhaps?) At the front desk we were told that because they were fully booked, they could only offer us another room in the same grade, or a ""renovated"" room for an extra 30 Euros per night.",0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-9.json_9,(Fully booked?,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-9.json_10,But they could still find a better room for an additional fee?,0
berlin-hotel-191437-review-9.json_11,"I'm not sure that I follow that logic, but whatever.) After our overseas flight we really didn't feel like arguing, so we just paid the extra - no way to say now if the other room in the same grade would have been acceptable.",0

berlin-hotel-191438-review-1.json_0,I haven't stayed at too many nicer hotels.,0
berlin-hotel-191438-review-1.json_1,Nor would I generally spend over 300 Euros for a hotel (thankfully my Mom was paying for this stay).,0

berlin-hotel-191438-review-1.json_14,"My complaints about the hotel: (1) Charging 22 Euros/day for lousy (off/on) internet service is a bit outrageous given the very high room charges, (2) Temperature difficult to adjust in the room (no thermostat),",0
berlin-hotel-191438-review-1.json_15,"and we couldn't get it quite cool enough for comfort, (3) Rather thin towels for a luxury hotel, (4) Needless step to the beds; great for tripping on (especially for an older person such as my mother).",0
